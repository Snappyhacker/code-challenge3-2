- Functions
- Decorators
- Sequences
- Sets and Dictionaries
- Object-Oriented Programming

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd python-coding-assessment



### Submission Instructions

After you’ve completed the code:

1. **Create a new private GitHub repository**:
    - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
    - Create a new repository and make sure it’s set to **private**.
    - Clone the repository to your local machine:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
      ```

2. **Push your solution**:
    - Add the Python files and README.md.
    - Commit your changes:
      ```bash
      git add .
      git commit -m "Initial commit for Python coding assessment"
      git push origin main
      ```

This setup ensures that all tasks are complete and functional. Your instructor will be able to see the functionality of each task by running the tests in the terminal.
